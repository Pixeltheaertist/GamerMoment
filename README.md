BLOODY HELL, IT'S A FUKKEN GIT REPO

This github repo is a github repo, involving github.

Git meaning github, and repo meaning repository.

Github is an application allowing coders and project developers to cooperate across devices on the same code.
Repository -- meaning a containment unit or storage medium, in which a certain object is safely stored en masse. In this case, it is code.

Github + Repository = GithubRepository
GithubRespository = Github Repo
